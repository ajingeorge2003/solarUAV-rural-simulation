# Design and Feasibility Analysis of a Solar-Assisted Multi-Purpose Drone for Rural Deployment

## 📌 Overview
This research investigates the feasibility of **solar-assisted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)** for rural applications in India.  
The study combines **real irradiance datasets** with **simulation-based modeling** to evaluate endurance, energy flow, and intelligent power management between solar and battery sources.  
The goal is to propose a sustainable UAV solution aligned with **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 7, 9, 11)**.

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Literature Review** – Analyze existing solar UAV studies and identify gaps.  
2. **Data Collection** – Obtain Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) datasets.  
3. **System Modeling** –  
   - Solar harvesting (panel area, PV efficiency).  
   - Power consumption (propulsion + avionics).  
   - Battery dynamics (State of Charge model).  
4. **Control Logic** – Rule-based solar/battery switching.  
5. **Simulations** – Run baseline (battery-only) and solar-assisted missions under clear/cloudy conditions.  
6. **Analysis** – Compare endurance and feasibility; map to SDGs.
